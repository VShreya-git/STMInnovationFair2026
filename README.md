SNN-Based Adaptive EMG Prosthetic Arm with Qi Wireless Charging and Intelligent Battery Management
Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of an adaptive EMG-controlled prosthetic arm integrating spike-based signal processing with intelligent power management. The system acquires surface electromyography (EMG) signals from muscle activity, which are conditioned, digitized, and processed using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for real-time gesture classification. The classified outputs are translated into PWM control signals to actuate multiple servo motors, enabling coordinated prosthetic arm movement.

To ensure operational reliability and long-duration wearable functionality, the system incorporates a Qi-compliant wireless charging module alongside an integrated Battery Management System (BMS). The BMS continuously monitors Li-Po battery voltage, estimates the remaining charge percentage, and detects critical low-power thresholds to prevent deep discharge and unexpected shutdowns.

By combining adaptive signal interpretation, embedded real-time control, and intelligent energy management, this project demonstrates a compact and energy-aware prosthetic platform suitable for advanced assistive and rehabilitation applications.
