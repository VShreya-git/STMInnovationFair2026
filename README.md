# SNN-Based Adaptive EMG Prosthetic Arm with Qi Wireless Charging and Intelligent Battery Management

This project presents the design and implementation of an adaptive EMG-controlled prosthetic arm that integrates spike-inspired signal processing with embedded real-time control and intelligent power supervision. The system acquires surface electromyography (sEMG) signals generated by residual muscle activity, which are amplified, filtered, and digitized for further processing.

The conditioned signals are encoded into spike-based representations and processed using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) implemented on an embedded microcontroller for real-time gesture classification. The classified outputs are translated into PWM control signals that drive multiple servo motors, enabling coordinated and responsive prosthetic arm movements.

To ensure safe and long-duration wearable operation, the platform incorporates a Qi-compliant wireless charging module alongside an intelligent Battery Management System (BMS). The BMS continuously monitors Li-Po battery voltage, estimates the remaining state-of-charge (SoC), and enforces low-voltage protection to prevent deep discharge.

When the battery level falls below predefined thresholds, the system automatically transmits low-power alerts to the user via WiFi, enabling proactive charging and preventing unexpected system shutdown. This network-enabled power supervision enhances reliability and user safety in real-world operation.

By combining adaptive EMG interpretation, embedded spike-based classification, wireless charging capability, and intelligent energy monitoring with remote alerting, this project demonstrates a compact, connected, and energy-aware prosthetic platform suitable for advanced assistive and rehabilitation applications.

In summary, the proposed system delivers an energy-aware, adaptive prosthetic solution that combines real-time EMG interpretation, intelligent battery supervision, and wireless charging to enhance reliability, usability, and user safety.
